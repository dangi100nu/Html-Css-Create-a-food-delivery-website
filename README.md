# Html-Css-Create-a-food-delivery-website
in this project i am using pure css without using bootstrap because at the time of create this website i don't know how to use bootstrap.
but at the time of upload i know bootstrap very well. so i am update soon.
I am a junior web developer. i am creating a simple food delivery website using html and css. 
i know this type of website easily created by chatgpt but this is my first try so i am very happy for this.
in this project i learn how to add repo on github using you git commond line.
